# SDL2 samples

Adapted from the tutorials found at <http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php>.

Data files aren't included, to avoid bloating the repository. Download
and extract them as you see fit in to `samples/data` directory.

You can use prepared scripts for downloading data files and compiling all samples:

```sh
cd samples
./download_data_files.sh
./compile_all_samples.sh
```
